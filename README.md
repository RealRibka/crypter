The program is a tool for encrypting and decrypting files. It browses directories, encrypts files and establishes full access control for the current user. The program also includes a method to delete temporary files. The main method accepts the path to the cryptographic files and the encryptor mode from the user. It then calls the TraverseTree and DelTempFiles methods to perform encryption/decryption and delete temporary files, respectively. The program is designed to run on Windows, as it uses Windows-specific functions.
